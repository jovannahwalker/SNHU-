Welcome to my portfolio repository. This repository contains various projects and artifacts that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in computer science and software engineering.

Sprint Review and Retrospective Artifact
For this course, I am including the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from my final project. This document captures the Agile and Scrum practices that I have applied throughout the course, detailing the work completed during the sprint and reflecting on the successes and areas for improvement.

Artifact: Sprint Review and Retrospective
Sprint Review: This section includes a summary of the work completed during the sprint, including features implemented, bugs fixed, and any other relevant accomplishments.
Sprint Retrospective: This section reflects on what went well during the sprint, what could be improved, and actionable steps to enhance future sprints.
Reflections on Essential Questions
Throughout my studies in the Computer Science program, I have encountered several key questions that are fundamental to the field. Below are my reflections on these questions:

1. How do computer scientists and software engineers solve problems?

Computer scientists and software engineers solve problems through a systematic approach that includes analyzing the problem, designing algorithms, and implementing solutions. They break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and use logical reasoning and computational thinking to devise efficient algorithms and data structures. The iterative development process, guided by methodologies like Agile and Scrum, allows for continuous testing, feedback, and refinement, ensuring robust and effective solutions.

2. What does it mean to be a responsible and ethical computer scientist or software engineer?

Being a responsible and ethical computer scientist or software engineer involves adhering to principles of integrity, honesty, and fairness. It requires considering the societal and environmental impacts of technology, ensuring the privacy and security of user data, and creating inclusive and accessible solutions. Ethical professionals are committed to continuous learning and are mindful of the ethical implications of emerging technologies, striving to use their skills for the greater good.

3. How can computer scientists and software engineers engage in lifelong learning?

Lifelong learning is essential for computer scientists and software engineers to stay current with rapidly evolving technologies. This can be achieved through formal education, online courses, attending conferences, participating in professional communities, and collaborating with peers. Staying curious and proactive in seeking new knowledge, experimenting with new tools, and reading research papers are also crucial for continuous growth and adaptation in the field.

4. How do teams of computer scientists and software engineers work together?

Effective teamwork in computer science and software engineering involves collaboration, communication, and a shared vision. Teams use methodologies like Agile and Scrum to manage projects, define roles, and set goals. Regular meetings, clear documentation, code reviews, and version control systems facilitate coordination and knowledge sharing. By fostering an environment of trust, respect, and open communication, teams can efficiently tackle complex problems, innovate, and deliver high-quality software solutions.
